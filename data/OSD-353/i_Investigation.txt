Study Protocol Description	For proteomic analysis, 200 μL of blood plasma was used for high-abundance protein depletion (ProteoMinerTM, BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) and a concentration of low-abundance proteins. The samples were prepared via the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol using 10 kDa filters (Merc, London, UK). Plasma proteins were reduced with 0.1 М DTT in 8 M Urea (pH 8.5); alkylated with 0.55M iodoacetamide and digested using trypsin (17 hours, 37C).	The tryptic peptide fraction (injection volume 2 uL) was analyzed in triplicate on a nano-HPLC Dionex Ultimate3000 system (Thermo) coupled to a MaXis 4G (Bruker, Bremen, Germany) using a nanospray ion source(positive ion mode, 1600 V). HPLC separation was performed on a C18 capillary column (75 µm x 50cm, C18, 3µm, 100 A) at a flow rate of 0.3 uL/min by gradient elution with the mobile phase A being 0.1% formic acid in water and mobile phase B - 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. The separation was carried out by a 120-min gradient (H2O/ACN containing 0.1% of formic acid) from 3% to 90% of ACN.	MS data were analyzed using the MaxQuant (v 1.5.4.1) program against the SwissProt Human database with the initial precursor mass error – 10 ppm. The minimum peptide length for identification was set to 7 amino acids; the match between the runs option was activated. The cutoff false discovery rate (FDR) for proteins and peptides was set to 0.01 (1% FDR). At least two unique peptide identifications per protein were required. Label free quantitative analysis was performed in order to determine the significantly changed proteins.MS data were analyzed using the MaxQuant (v 1.5.4.1) program against the SwissProt Human database with the initial precursor mass error – 10 ppm.

"Blood plasma samples were collected from 13 cosmonauts (male, age: 46 ± 6 years) before and after long-duration (169–199 days) missions on the ISS (International Space Station). All subjects provided written informed consent to participate in the ‘‘Proteome’’ experiment.

Five healthy men from 20 to 44 years of age were included in the head-down bedrest experiment (HDBR). They voluntarily remained in a bed rest position with an angle of inclination of the longitudinal axis of the body relative to the horizontal position of 6° for 21 days. Subjects characteristics were as follows: 34.3 ± 8.3 year (age), 1.76 ± 0.06 m (height), 69.8 ± 8.0 kg (weight), body mass index 22.4 ± 1.7 (BMI). All the subjects consumed controlled amount of all nutrients in the diet such as proteins, fats, carbohydrates and vitamins, calculated (calories per day) according to general recommendations by the European Space Agency (ESA). The studies were conducted under controlled life conditions of the volunteers at the MEDES research center in Toulouse, France. The examined group was not exposed to any additional stress to prevent the development of adaptive changes in physiological systems. More detailed subjects’ characteristics, medical check-up, inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as dropout criteria and study design have been described previously.

Samples from the dry immersion study were obtained from 5 volunteers participating in a 21-day-long experiment. Subject characteristics were as follows: 27.5 ± 3.7 year (age), 1.76 ± 0.05 m (height), 75.7 ± 8.4 kg (weight), 24.1 ± 1.3 (BMI). All the subjects consumed a controlled amount of all nutrients in the diet such as proteins, fats, carbohydrates and vitamins, calculated (calories per day) according to general recommendations by the World Health Organization (WHO). This study was conducted under controlled life conditions at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBP) of the Russian Federation State Scientific.  During ground-based experiments, cushion using was not restricted. Participants selected for the experiments were non-smokers, non-drugs takers and did not exhibit acute or chronic pathologies which could affect the physiological data. The volunteers had normal clinical and paramedical examination and laboratory tests (hematology and blood chemistry). All the participants gave their informed consent to the experimental conditions after the details of the protocol were explained to them.

All blood samples (~6 mL) were taken from a vein in the cubital fossa, the collection was done in commercial Monovette tubes (SARSTEDT, Germany) containing EDTA (K3) as the anticoagulant. No protease inhibitors or antimicrobial agents were added. The samples were centrifuged for plasma separation (2000 rpm for 15 min, +4 °C) immediately after collection. The supernatant was frozen at −80 °C and stored before further sample preparation for LC-MS analysis. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations."
