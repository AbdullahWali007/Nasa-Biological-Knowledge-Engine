Study Protocol Description	"Mice were flown onboard STS-135 that lifted off at 11:29 am EDT on July 8, 2011 and landed at 5:57 am on July 21, 2011. The mission duration was 12 days, 18 hours, 28 minutes.

Female 9 to 11 week-old C57BL/6CR mice were assigned to one of two experimental groups: Flight (FLT) and Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) ground controls. The flight animals were housed in AEMs identical to the ground controls, and our analysis focuses on the comparison between these two conditions.

The AEM was located in the middeck locker of the Space Shuttle, and the temperature was set at 3 to 8C above the environmental middeck temperature. Lighting of 14 lux was set to a 12 hour day/12 hour night cycle for both FLT and AEM habitats."	The absorbed dose from ionizing radiation received by the flight specimens was estimated using TLD passive dosimeters located in the middeck of the space shuttle, where the payload was located. More specifically, we computed the average between three dosimeters (DLOC1, DLOC2, and DLOC3) for the mission and we divided it by the total duration of the mission to estimate the average absorbed dose rate in mGy/day. This dose rate did not include any shielding effects from the hardware where the specimens resided. The total absorbed dose in water was then computed by simply multiplying the average dose rate with the duration of the experiment. The duration of the experiment was defined as the time in space during which the specimen was 'living'. Once the specimen was frozen or fixed, the experiment was considered stopped. A table with these detailed computations for all space shuttle datasets is available on GeneLab at https://www.nasa.gov/reference/osdr-environmental-data/.  The ground samples were not assessed for radiation exposure.	Both eyes from three animals for each group (n equals 3) were used in this study, one for gene expression analysis and the other for histology. After euthanasia at day one of landing, one eye of each mouse was enucleated and fixed for histologic examination. The contralateral eye was placed in RNA preservative (RNAlater) until further dissection, which was performed by making an incision by scalpel to separate the posterior eye cup, removing the lens and vitreous and carefully scraping the retina. The retina was then placed again in RNAlater and processed for gene expression profiling by microarray analysis.	Total RNA was then isolated from the retina using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and analyzed for quality using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA).	Microarray gene expression analysis was performed at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston Molecular Genomics Core. Please contact UTMB for protocol details.	"Microarray gene expression analysis was performed at the
University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston Molecular Genomics Core using Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 GeneChip (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) with
Affymetrix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console for secondary analysis."	Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7114 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/Microarray/Affymetrix/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7114_Versions/GL-DPPD-7114.md) using NF_MAAffymetrix version 1.0.5 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_MAAffymetrix_1.0.5/Microarray/Affymetrix/Workflow_Documentation/NF_MAAffymetrix). In short, a RunSheet containing raw data file location and processing metadata from the study's *ISA.zip file was generated using dp_tools (version 1.3.4). The raw array data files were loaded into R (version 4.1.3) using oligo (version 1.58.0). Raw data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). The raw probe level intensity data was background corrected and normalized across arrays via the oligo (version 1.58.0) quantile method. Normalized probe level data quality assurance density plot, pseudo images, MA plots, and boxplots were generated using oligo (version 1.58.0). Normalized probe level data was summarized to the probeset level using the oligo (version 1.58.0) RMA method. Ensembl gene ID mappings were retrieved for each probeset using biomaRt (version 2.50.0), Ensembl database (ensembl.org, release 107). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using limma (version 3.50.3); all groups were compared pairwise for each probeset to generate a moderated t-statistic and associated p- and adjusted p-value. Gene annotations were assigned for every probeset that mapped to exactly one Ensembl gene ID using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.15.0).
