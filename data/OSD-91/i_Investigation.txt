STUDY
Study Identifier	OSD-91
Study Title	A study of gene expression influenced by simulated microgravity in human lymphoblastoid cells
Study Description	Here, in this study we systematically examined the patterns of DNA methylation and hydroxy-methylation with its functional implications in gene regulation for the cultured TK6 lymphoblastoid cells upon exposure to micro-gravity conditions. The results reported here indicate that simulated microgravity alters methylation patterns in a limited way and subsequently the expression of genes involved in stress response like ATF3, FBXO17, MAP3K13 and VCL in TK6 cells. Overall design: Examination of RNA-seq with 2 replicates each for 1 cell type

Study Protocol Description	TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were maintained in the log phase of cell growth by culturing in RPMI-1640 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) medium supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) at 37C in 5% CO2 and 95% air.	For ground-based simulation of microgravity, HARV rotating suspension culture bioreactors (Synthecon, Houston, TX) were used. Actively growing (96-98% viable) TK6 cells were seeded in the bioreactor at 2 X 10^5 cells/ml and rotated at 12 rpm/min. For control, cells (at the same cellular density i.e 2 X 10^5 cells/ml) were maintained in bioreactors in a normal gravity (static) condition as controls	Total RNA was extracted from cells subjected to simulated microgravity and static control using RNA-STAT-60 (Tel-Test,Inc., Friendswood, TX) using the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1ml of RNA-STAT solution was added per 10^6 cells and homogenized for 5 minutes over ice. 1ml of chloroform was added, contents shaken vigorously and centrifuged at 12,000g at 4C for 15 minutes. The aqueous solution was transferred to corex tube (Corning Inc., Lowell, MA) and 0.8 ml isopropanol added. After incubation of 10 minutes, the contents were centrifuged at 12,000g for another 10 minutes to precipitate the RNA. The RNA pellet was washed with 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500g for 5 minutes at 4C. The ethanol was aspirated and the RNA pellet dried. The RNA pellet was finally resuspended in DEPC water and submitted to the Purdue Genomic Center for conversion into cDNA, sonication, adapter ligation and sequencing.	RNA was converted into cDNA and was end-repaired using repair solution (combination of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment and T4 polynucleotide kinase). A-tailing was obtained by incubating the end repaired DNA with dA-tailing mix. Blunt end ligation was performed by incubating the A-tailed DNA samples (1 ug) with adapters (IDT Inc., Coralville, IA), unmethylated version of Truseq adapters (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA) for multiplexing. After adapter ligation DNA was PCR amplified with Illumina primers for 15 cycles and library fragments of ~250 bp (insert plus adaptor and PCR primer sequences) were band isolated from an agarose gel. The purified DNA was captured on an Illumina flow cell for cluster generation.	Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq2000 following the manufacturer's protocols.	Raw fastq files were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) and filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.2). Raw and trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.8), and MultiQC (version 1.7) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.1a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 98, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.toplevel.fa), and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.98.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.1a) and aligned reads were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.1.8) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0). Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the GeneLab Reference Annotations pipeline (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).
