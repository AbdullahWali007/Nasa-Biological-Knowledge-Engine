Study Protocol Description	"For Apollo 15 samples, the relative humidity was 50 to 90% in all growth cabinets. Seeds and seedlings experienced a 16 hr photoperiod, mixture of CWF and Sylvania W.W. Gro-Liix at 1500-300 ft-cc.  The challenge unit was an open jar with Hoagland's solution. The growth temperature was 18-27C.

The growth protocol for Apollo 16 samples (Citrus limonia and Marchantia) is unknown."	"For Apollo 15 samples: Dose was 0.22 g/replicate and 10 replicates were pooled for analysis (for all samples except brussel sprouts reported from MMP 21243). Brussel sprout is distinguished from cabbage in the sample name by the acronym for the variety. Brussel sprout samples include the string 'BoleraceaeLII' to indicate Brassica oleracea 'Long Island Improvement', the strain name. Dose was 0.22 g/replicate and 6 replicates were pooled for analysis (for brussel sprout samples from MMP 21243). Treatment material was applied directly to seeds.

For Apollo 16 samples (Citrus limonia and Marchantia): treatment protocol is unknown"	"For Apollo 15 samples: All values are means of triplicate determinations on one lot of seedlings for each treatment, and are expressed as micrograms of element per gram dry weight.

For Apollo 16 samples (Citrus limonia and Marchantia) sample collection protocol is unknown"	All details pertaining to this assay are in the supplemental files under the Files section.

If you review the material associated with this dataset and have a suggestion for an improvement, correction or addition please let us know at arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov. The elemental analysis data has been attached to this protocol because it was the most common at the time of assay. Data reported a micrograms of element per gram of dry plant weight.

All details pertaining to this assay are in the supplemental files under the Files section. Hydride Generation Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy was not widely available until the mid-19070's, therefore unlikely to have been used in this study. Due to the historic nature of these experiments some metadata is absent or unclear in the available documentation. At OSDR we welcome contributions from our community.
