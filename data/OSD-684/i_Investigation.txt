Study Title	Human skeletal muscle tissue chip autonomous payload reveals changes in fiber type and metabolic gene expression due to spaceflight.
Study Description	Microphysiological systems provide the opportunity to model accelerated changes at the human tissue level in the extreme space environment. Spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy experienced by astronauts shares similar physiological changes to muscle wasting in older adults, known as sarcopenia. These shared attributes provide a rationale for investigating molecular changes in muscle cells exposed to spaceflight that may mimic the underlying pathophysiology of sarcopenia. We report the results from three-dimensional myobundles derived from muscle biopsies from young and older adults, integrated into an autonomous CubeLab™, and flown to the International Space Station (ISS) aboard SpaceX CRS-21 as part of the NIH/NASA funded Tissue Chips in Space program. Global transcriptomic RNA-Seq analyses comparing the myobundles in space and on the ground revealed downregulation of shared transcripts related to myoblast proliferation and muscle differentiation. The analyses also revealed downregulated differentially expressed gene pathways related to muscle metabolism unique to myobundles derived from the older cohort exposed to the space environment compared to ground controls. Gene classes related to inflammatory pathways were downregulated in flight samples cultured from the younger cohort compared to ground controls. Our muscle tissue chip platform provides an approach to studying the cell autonomous effects of spaceflight on muscle cell biology that may not be appreciated on the whole organ or organism level and sets the stage for continued data collection from muscle tissue chip experimentation in microgravity. We also report on the challenges and opportunities for conducting autonomous tissue-on-chip CubeLab™ payloads on the ISS.

Study Protocol Description	Vastus lateralis biopsies were obtained from volunteers, phenotyped by age and physical activity at the Translational Research Institute at AdventHealth, Orlando. All participants provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board at AdventHealth, Orlando (IRBNet  554559). Cells were received at the University of Florida through a signed Material Transfer Agreement. The active group engaged in structured exercise at least 3 times per week and the sedentary group exercised one or less times per week. Satellite cells from individual donors were isolated, pre-plated to remove fibroblasts and pooled in equal ratios to generate a mean cell stock of young, active cohort (YA; 21–40 years, male, n equals 5) and old, sedentary cohort (OS, 65–80 years, male, n  equals  5) prior to cryopreservation and shipment to the University of Florida through a Material Transfer Agreement and in the absence of any patient identifiable information. Muscle myoblasts were thawed and then cultured on T75 flasks coated with collagen I in Skeletal Muscle Growth medium (PromoCell, Heidelberg, Germany) to confluence. Immunopurification of mononuclear myoblasts was performed using mouse monoclonal 5.1H11 anti-CD56 antibody (DSHB Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA). CD56+ myoblasts were confirmed by FACS as described.	"Pre-Flight Treatment:
Custom microfluidic chips made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and containing two platinum 22-gauge electrode leads were obtained from Micro-gRx, INC, (Orlando, FL), sterilized in ethanol and autoclaved at 150 C for 30 min prior to use. Cell seeding was performed at NASA’s Kennedy Space Station Processing Facility (SSPF) for flight and at the University of Florida laboratory for the ground test. Injectable hydrogel mixtures (3.3 mg/mL rat tail collagen I, and 22% (v/v) Matrigel) were combined with the 5-donor pooled YA- or the 5-donor pooled OS-derived CD56+ enriched myoblasts. The cell-laden hydrogels were injected into the PDMS chips to a final cell density of 15 and 20 million cells/mL for pooled YA- and pooled OS-derived cells, respectively. Cells were allowed to polymerize at 37 °C for 60 min and seeding ports were sealed using polylactic acid (PLA, Makerbot, Brooklyn, NY) plugs. Chips were perfused with degassed Skeletal Muscle Growth media supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml Primocin (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 using programmable syringe pumps (Cole Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL). After 48 h, the culturing medium was changed to degassed differentiation media I (MEM-a, 0.5% (v/v) ITS, 2%(v/v) B27,10 uM DAPT, 1 uM Dabrafenib, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 and, 0.1 mg/mL Primocin) and delivered at an intermittent rate of 125 ul min−1 for 1 min every 8 h for 6 days before integrating the chips for flight or ground studies.

For spaceflight tissues, the sterile CubeLab fluidic system was flushed with sterile Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS) followed by priming with degassed differentiation media II (MEM-a, 0.5% (v/v) ITS, 2%(v/v) B27, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.3 and, 0.1 mg ml-1 Primocin). PBS effluent was collected, plated, and incubated at 37 °C for 5 days followed by RT (20–25 °C) for 5 days (sterile PBS was plated as control). No colonies were present confirming sterility of the fluidic system. 48 h prior to launch (L-2), tissue chips were exchanged with 1 ml media, disconnected from the syringe pump, inspected under a 10x microscope and 16 chips were integrated into a custom designed 9U CubeLab (Space Tango, Lexington KY). Of the 16 chips, there were eight chip replicates of the YA mean cohort and eight chip replicates of the OS mean cohort (8x YA and 8x OS). On L-3, flight chips were secured PDMS-side down onto fluid connection ports which allowed for fluid-tight mating to the manifold chip posts via press fit connections. A low pulsatile annular gear pump and Takasago-modified valves, controlled fluid to each chip. Two thermoelectric coolers located on the opposite side of the chips ensured consistent temperature (37–39 °C). The stimulation circuit was connected to eight chip’s stimulation leads via blue wire and connectors custom to the stimulation board mounted on one side of the manifold. 200 ml of chilled, degassed media II was added to the source bag and placed into the cold flask (4–8 °C). Chilled RNALater (20 ml) was added to a second source bag and placed into the cold flask (4–8 °C). Fluid from each chip (200 ml) was routed to general waste. The payload was sealed, purged with 5% CO2 using an air gas canister and the thermal protocol was initiated to bring the manifold to 37 °C. Prior to handover, a leak test was performed to verify pressure integrity and the CubeLab was integrated into the powered accent utility locker (PAUL). Once in the PAUL, the camera system was initiated and calibrated for each chip position and the Media Exchange-Waste sequence I (outlined below) was initiated prior to handover to NASA at L-1.

Flight Treatment:
On-orbit payload operation  After docking (L + 2), the CubeLab was installed by crew members and operated from within the PAUL. After install, the following protocols were initiated: (1) The Media Exchange-Waste sequence 2. During this event, media was flowed to each chip every 8 h at 125 ul per  min for 1 min and output volume was sent to general waste. (2) The Z-Stack event. During this event, the microscope (10x magnification) was moved to chip N and captured six phase contrast slices at 12 um increments at each chip’s pre-defined position immediately before and after each Media-Exchange-Waste event. (3) The Stimulation and Video event was initiated on L + 9. During this event, 8 chips (4x YA and 4x OS) were electrically stimulated. The remaining 8 chips (4x YA and 4x OS) were non-stimulated. The intended program involved moving the microscope to chip N’s ideal position and recording video at 25 fps for 40 s (pre-stimulation phase), then at the 41 s mark after video initiation, a stimulation waveform (3 V, 2 Hz, 2msec) on chip N was elicited and video was to be recorded for an additional 40 s (stimulation phase). Finally, at the 82 s mark after video initiation, the stimulation waveform ceased, and video was to be recorded for 40 s (recovery phase) for total of 120 s of video for each of the 8 chips. The program was to be repeated every 24 h for 5 days. The executed program included stimulation of the 8 chips for 30 min on one day prior to initiation of fixation.  Asynchronous ground experiment  The ground experiment was performed at the University of Florida approximately 30 days following the return and de-integration of the flight study. Aliquots from the same lot of pooled YA and pooled OS cells (8x YA and 8x OS) used for flight were used for the ground study and the 16 tissue chips were seeded and differentiated as described in the Preparation of Bioengineered Myobundles (Flight and Ground) section. On the equivalent of day “L-3”, ground chips remained connected to the syringe pumps in the cell incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) and differentiation media I in 3 ml syringes were changed to degassed differentiation media II and delivered to the ground chips every 8 h at 125 ul per  min for 1 min to mimic the integration of the flight chips into the CubeLab and the switch from media I to II. On the equivalent day as “L + 9”, 8 chips (4x YA and 4x OS) were electrically stimulated with wave form 3 V, 2 Hz, 2msec for 30 min using a custom microcontroller and circuit board as described1. No video was collected as we did not have the capability to record inside the incubator. The remaining 8 chips (4x YA and 4x OS) were non-stimulated.  On-orbit payload operation  The Fixation event. During this event, RNALater was initiated to each chip at 125  ul per  min for 5 min at termination of the experiment. Crew members removed the CubeLab from the PAUL and transferred to the ICEBERG cold stowage asset, at −35 °C. Continuous telemetry from the CubeLab environment was recorded in the customer dashboard portal. Z-stacked images of each chip per day and the stimulation video were downlinked to the portal system. An open-source digital image correlation (DIC) algorithm based in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA) was used to quantify displacements at the region of interest in the tissue chip as previously described.

Asynchronous ground experiment:
On the equivalent day as “L + 10”, the tissue chips were disconnected from the syringe pump and 1 ml of RNALater was manually added to the chips to mimic flight samples and stored at −20 °C for more than 24 h."

Payload splashdown from SpaceX CRS-21 occurred on January 14, 2021, and the CubeLabTM was transferred from a Double Cold Bag (conditioned at −32 °C) to a −80 °C freezer at NASA’s Kennedy SSPF processing laboratory where the CubeLabTM was de- integrated and chips were removed and immediately processed for RNA isolation. Flight chips in RNALater were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) prepared with B-mercaptoethanol.  Asynchronous ground experiment:  On the equivalent day as “L + 10”, the tissue chips were disconnected from the syringe pump and 1 ml of RNALater was manually added to the chips to mimic flight samples and stored at −20 °C for more than 24 h.	Post-flight RNA extraction  Payload splashdown from SpaceX CRS-21 occurred on January 14, 2021, and the CubeLab was transferred from a Double Cold Bag (conditioned at −32 °C) to a −80 °C freezer at NASA’s Kennedy SSPF processing laboratory where the CubeLab was de-integrated and chips were removed and immediately processed for RNA isolation. Flight chips in RNALater were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) prepared with B-mercaptoethanol. RNA isolation was then performed using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. The integrity of the extracted RNA was assessed by Agilent 2200 Tapestation system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). Only the non-stimulated samples were compared and reported in this communication.	RNA sequencing analysis  Libraries of extracted RNA samples were built using the NEBNext® Ultra™ Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA) RNA sample preparation kit and yielded fragments with 220–700 base pairs.	The qualified fragments were ligated with 60 adapters, amplified, and submitted for sequencing by Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to generate paired end reads with a length of 150 bases.	The input sequences were trimmed using trimmomatic. Quality control was performed before and after trimming using FastQC (v 0.11.4) and MultiQC and a total of 50 million reads were generated for each sample yielding coverage in the range of 118 to 220 bases for each sample, Then the input sequences were aligned to the transcriptome using the STAR aligner, version 2.7.9a. Transcript abundance was quantified using RSEM (RSEM v1.3.1), and genes with insufficient average counts were excluded from further statistical analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq2 package, with an FDR-corrected P-value threshold of 0.05. The results were further filtered to extract transcripts showing a 2.0-fold change (log2FC) in either direction.  Differential expression and functional annotation analysis of RNA-seq data  Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from YA- and OS flight samples were normalized to the matching ground control group and reported as log2 of the fold change (log2FC). Fold induction values were averaged for all experiments performed as experimental triplicates for each cohort. RNA-seq data were analyzed by iPathwayGuide (Advaita Bioinformatics: http://www.advaitabio.com/ipathwayguide.html) by identifying significantly impacted signaling pathways. Volcano plots, which rely on double filtering criterion and display unstandardized signal log2FC against noise-adjusted/standardized signal FDR-corrected P-value, were used to display up- and down-regulated DEGs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Pathway enrichment analysis were performed by comparing DEGs with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases where p  less than 0.05 was statistically significant. Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery database (DAVID, https://david.ncifcrf.gov/) was used to determine the biological meaning to a given set of DEGs and categorized them by GO-molecular function, GO-biological process, and GO-cellular component. In DAVID database, Fisher’s Exact test is adopted to measure the gene-enrichment in annotation terms. Fisher’s Exact p-values are computed by summing probabilities p over defined sets of tables (Prob  equals  ∑Ap) and looks for any functional enrichment against a background that consist of all Homo Sapiens genes. Each GO term is used to describe the features of genes and gene products. For each Gene Ontology (GO) term, the number of DEGs annotated to the term is compared against the number of genes expected by chance. Significance of each GO term was assessed using the default homo sapiens GO annotation as background. A GO term was considered statistically significant at FDR-corrected P  less than or equal to  0.05. IPathwayGuide uses an overrepresentation test, based on a hypergeometric distribution, to compute the statistical significance of observing more than the expected number of DEGs. Significance of GO terms were assessed using the default Homo Sapiens GO annotation as background. A GO term was considered statistically significant at FDR-corrected P  less than or equal to  0.05. Next, Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships (PANTHER v.13.0, www.pantherdb.org) Classification System was used to perform protein-encoding genes functional classification and provide information about protein families. PANTHER uses an overrepresentation test, FDR-corrected P  less than or equal to  0.05. The analysis was applied only to DEGs with cut-off of adjusted p-value of 0.05 and fold-change  greater than or equal to  ±2.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12. rRNA percentages of reads were estimated with the 'hts_SeqScreener' program of htstream v1.3.3 screened against a fasta file of H-sapiens rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021.	Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-F (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-F.md), using NF_RCP-F version 1.0.4 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-F_1.0.4/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP-F). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.7) powered by Cutadapt (version 3.7). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.11.9), and MultiQC (version 1.12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.10a) and RSEM (version 1.3.1), respectively, Ensembl release 107, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.107.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.10a) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 4.0.0), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 4.0.0), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 4.0.0), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 4.0.0). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.1), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.12). The runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.4) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.1.3) with tximport (version 1.27.1) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.34.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.1.3) using DESeq2 (version 1.34.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable_1.0.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110/GL-DPPD-7110.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.8.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.11), and org.Hs.eg.db (version 3.15.0).
