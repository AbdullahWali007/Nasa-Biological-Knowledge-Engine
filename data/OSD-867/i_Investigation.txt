Study Title	Impact of spaceflight on gene expression in cultured human mesenchymal stem/stromal cell
Study Description	With technological advancements, human's desire to explore space is growing and more people are staying longer at the international space station (ISS). The impact of microgravity on stem cells (SC) is not fully understood. We explored the impact of microgravity on gene expression profile of cultured mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) at the ISS. We also evaluated how the new knowledge gained sheds light on our understanding of human physiology on Earth. Primary cultures of MSCs were expanded at the ISS for 1 or 2 weeks and mRNA was isolated from samples of the cultured cells. Gene expression profiles were determined and compared with samples from real-time ground control cultures. Differential gene expression, gene set enrichment analysis and determination of key genes were performed that revealed for the first time the existence of potential 'master regulators' coordinating a systemic response to microgravity. Cyclin D1 (CCND1), a protein-coding gene that regulates cell cycle progression and CDK kinases, was identified as the most connected regulator at week 1. Further analysis showed the impacted genes from cultured MSCs significantly correlated with known gene pathways associated with cell division, chromosomal segregation and nuclear division, extracellular matrix structure and organization, muscle apoptosis and differentiation. This study exemplifies the utility of space research to advance our understanding of human physiology both on Earth and in space. To investigate the effects of microgravity on MSC growth and understand the differences in gene expression profiles between microgravity and ground control environments, two groups of MSC were sent to the ISS. One group was cultured for one week, while the other was cultured for two weeks, with corresponding control groups processed similarly on Earth. The cells were then preserved and transferred back to the laboratory. Further Gene expression profiles were compared between samples to identify differentially expressed genes.

Study Protocol Description	The mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) were derived from a healthy, de-identified, discarded bone marrow sample using Histopaque-1077 (Sigma-Aldrich) according to density gradient protocols. The MSCs were grown in α minimum essential medium supplemented with 16.5% fetal bovine serum. The expanded MSCs were then seeded into BioCells at passage 4. The BioCells were divided into groups for 1-week or 2-week durations. The 1-week group was seeded with 5x10^4 MSCs, while the 2-week group was seeded with 2x10^4 MSCs. Identical BioCells were prepared as ground controls. All procedures fully complied with relevant regulations and Mayo Clinic’s IRB guidelines.	The experiments utilized BioServe’s single-well BioCell, a spaceflight-certified cell culture hardware capable of effectively supporting cell culture. MSCs-containing BioCells were transported to the ISS microgravity environment within Plate Habitats (PHABs). During launch rocket’s gravity forces can reach up to 5g. Upon arrival at the ISS, the PHABs were placed inside BioServe’s SABL unit, which maintains a temperature of 37°C and 5% CO2. MSCs cultures were processed at two intervals: 7 days and 14 days. Seeding densities were adjusted such that no media exchange was performed at ISS. Ground control MSCs underwent identical treatment to those in the microgravity environment.	At the designated termination timepoints, specifically after either one or two weeks of culture in space aboard the ISS, MSCs were subjected to trypsinization. This process facilitated the retrieval of single-cell suspensions, which were subsequently preserved in RNAprotect (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD) while still aboard the ISS.	Upon return to Earth, RNA isolation was conducted utilizing the miRNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN, Germantown, MD). Total RNA concentration and quality were determined using Qubit fluorometry (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and the Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA).	cDNA libraries were prepared using up to 200ng of total RNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the TruSeq RNA Library Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The concentration and size distribution of the completed libraries were determined using the Bioanalyzer and Qubit fluorometry.	Libraries were sequenced at an average of 35 million, 100 base pair paired-end reads per sample with Illumina’s standard protocol for the Illumina cBot and HiSeq 3000/4000 PE Cluster Kit.	Fastq format was checked with fastq_utils v0.25.1. Quality assessment of reads was performed with FastQC v0.11.9 and reports were combined with MultiQC v1.12.
