Study Title	Effect of varying amounts of simulated lunar soil batch #005 upon growth of lettuce explants
Study Description	The following general conclusions can be made concerning the use of tissue culture for assaying the effects of mineral elements from simulated lunar soil or other mineral samples: The method used here is a very sensitive one for showing that soluble materials are reaching the tissue explant. The effects found (inhibiting) are very probably caused by excess toxic materials or competition of non-essential elements with essential elements rather than pH changes because previously pH has been found- to have relatively little effect over a wide range. Any stimulatory effect of the simulated lunar soil will probably appear at concentrations below those used in these experiments. If this is the case, the method is much less wasteful of mineral materials than methods in which pre-grown callus is treated with mineral materials.  Measurements of uptake of minerals will be difficult in this system because of the relatively small growth obtainable from the tissue and also because of the apparently large background of minerals contributed by the purified agar.

Study Protocol Description	"Materials required are 5 or 10ml disposable plastic syringes, a piece of fine mesh nylon netting, a length of 1/8' OD vinyl tubing, a 2 liter filter flask, a one hole rubber stopper to fit the flask and a 1 ml pipette. The inside of the syringe barrel, but not the plunger, is thoroughly cleaned with chloroform and then a circle of nylon netting is welded to the inside of the closed end using a small heated rod. A short piece of vinyl tubing is pushed over the fitting leaving approximately 3/16 inch projecting beyond the tip. The plunger is replaced in the barrel. The pipette is inserted in the rubber stopper and adjusted so that when the flask is tightly stoppered the mouthpiece end of the pipette is just above the bottom of the flask. The delivery tip should then project approximately 1 inch above the top of the stopper. The flask containing 1500 ml of distilled water is autoclaved for 1 hour. The stopper and
pipette tip are covered with aluminum foil and the side arm of the flask is plugged with cotton. The syringe is loaded with 250 mg of seeds (200-250 lettuce seeds). A solution of hypochlorite is prepared in a 250
ml beaker. Sterilization is initiated by drawing the solution into the syringe and shaking rapidly to wet the seeds. After 1/2 minute the solution is expelled and replaced with fresh solution. Within the following 2 minutes
this is repeated four times. Seeds treated longer than 2-5 minutes are given a final change of the solution and allowed to sit until the end of treatment. To rinse the hypochlorite is expelled and distilled water is drawn from the distilled water flask through the projecting pipette tip, the vinyl tubing serving as a sealing collar. Rinsing is repeated 6 times over a period of 10 minutes."	The following lettuce varieties were used: 8 - Grand Rapids, 9 Ford-Hook,11-Oak Leaf, 17 -Prize Head. Explants were from seeds sterilized (described in seed sterilization protocol) and planted on agar prepared in Hoagland's  2 solution. Seedlings were allowed to grow 5-15 days before use. Whole leaves or parts of leaves were used. All plant parts were transferred to the surface of the tissue culture medium using aseptic technique but without further surface sterilization. Media used was Murashige and Skoogs medium as modified by S. Venketeswaran (SV medium). The basic SV and MS media are described in the NASA Protocol manual MSC 03267.  'SV basal medium' consisted of all salts hormones and vitamins of SV medium without the complex additives coconut milk and yeast extract and without ascorbic acid. Trace elements and vitamins were used in normal concentration. Solid medium was prepared with 1% purified Difco agar. Plastic 15 by 100 mm sterile disposable petri dishes were used for all experiments with growth on solid medium. Edges were sealed with scotch tape to retard desiccation. Formation of callus was allowed to progress for 4-6 weeks weeks at 24C under fluorescent light.' Growth was evaluated by fresh weight.	Simulated lunar soil lot  005 was weighed in varying amounts into capped polypropylene tubes and autoclaved at 1 psi.for twenty minutes. Prior to pouring of the medium (20 ml/ plate) the contents of individual tubes were emptied into the plates and mixed into the ungelled medium by gentle swirling. Leaf explants averaging 10 mg were planted on the solidified agar at the rate of 3 explants per plate.	Fresh total biomass was assessed for each sample. It is unclear if the tissue culture samples were preserved after being weighed. Due to the historic nature of these experiments some metadata is absent or unclear in the available documentation. At OSDR we welcome contributions from our community. If you review the material associated with this dataset and have a suggestion for an improvement, correction or addition please let us know at arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov.	Germination was considered to have occurred when the seed coat had ruptured and a visible root tip had emerged. Percentage is based on counts of 200 seeds. Simulated lunar soil treatment was applied to 4 week old leaf extant culture only. Seeds were not exposed to any lunar soil treatment.	Fresh (wet) total biomass was assessed for each sample. Due to the historic nature of these experiments some metadata is absent or unclear in the available documentation. At OSDR we welcome contributions from our community. If you review the material associated with this dataset and have a suggestion for an improvement, correction or addition please let us know at arc-dl-osdr-data@mail.nasa.gov.
