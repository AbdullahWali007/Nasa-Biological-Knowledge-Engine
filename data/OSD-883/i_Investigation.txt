Study Title	Analysis of Vegetable Seedlings Grown in Contact with Apollo 14 Lunar Surface Fines
Study Description	Chemical analysis and other measurements made on lunar-treated plant seedlings grown for 14 to 21 days demonstrate a direct interaction between germfree plants and lunar material. Treated plants dissolved and absorbed significant quantities of Al, Fe, and Ti from the lunar fines. Cabbage and Brussels sprouts were particularly efficient in the dissolution and absorption of Mn. These results suggested that the beneficial effects observed in the Apollo 11 and 12 quarantine studies might be caused by the uptake of ions from the lunar material.

Study Protocol Description	"Seeds to be tested in the Apollo 14 quarantine facilities were obtained from commercial sources and were disinfected with a buffered solution of calcium hypochlorite. The solution was prepared by mixing 174 ml of distilled water, 20 ml of calcium hypochlorite (17 g Ca(OCl)2 dissolved in 100 ml of water), 2.0 ml of 10% triton x-100, and 40 ml of phosphate buffer to adjust the pH to 6.5. This solution was used immediately after preparation to ensure optimum levels of chlorine. For treatment, seeds were placed in a sterile beaker, covered with the disinfectant solution for a 5 -min contact time, and were rinsed 3 times with sterile distilled water. Seed germination tests were
conducted in special slide trays which were filled partially with moistened BR-8, a woodpulp product (produced by the American Can Company) that is stabilized with acrylonitrile, and allowed to air-dry in a sterile room-temp
environment. Ten disinfected seeds of each species were placed in each of 10 chambers; however, for carrots, 15 seeds were used. After treatment with 0.22 g of lunar or terrestrial material, germination was initiated by watering
the slide trays. The planted seeds were kept in total darkness for 2 days then exposed to approximately 8,000 lux with a photoperiod of 16 hr. The temp of the biological containment cabinet was maintained at approximately 23°C. Seeds were
moistened with distilled water for the first 7 days; thereafter, they were watered with a solution of major elements, until the end of the test. Controls consisted of equal numbers of: 1) units treated with sterilized terrestrial material, and 2) untreated units."	"An analysis of the lunar and terrestrial materials used in the test Based upon dry wt of the respective samples. Terrestrial material was prepared by the Physical Chemical Section of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. Samples were ground to pass 105u screen, except lunar sample A which was composed of the particles less than 105u.

 The lunar materials were of 2 types: type A, which passed 105-u sieve without grinding, and type B, which passed a 1-mm sieve but
required grinding to pass the 105-u sieve. Type A had a higher glass content, as was reported for fines from Apollo 11 and 12 collections. Both types were classified as lunar-surface “fines”, to designate materials passing a 1-cm sieve without grinding. The terrestrial basalt-ilmenite control was mixed and ground to simulate Apollo 11 fine materials which passed a 105-u sieve. This material was sterilized for 24 hr at 160° C and used in the same manner as the lunar sample. Seeds were germinated on BR-8, a soil substitute, and grown at 23°C for 14 to 21 days. Ten replicates were employed, except for lettuce where six replicates were used for another analysis. One hundred seeds were planted for all but carrot where 150 seeds were used per treatment. The detailed elemental analysis of the treatment growth media is reported in the sample table."	"Radish seedlings were collected at 14 days by cutting the stem at the soil line, drying the top portion at 105° C until constant wt was obtained, and then ashing the dry samples. The other seedlings were collected on the
following schedule: cabbage at 17 days, broccoli and lettuce at 18 days, Brussels sprouts at 19 days, and carrots at 21 days. The samples were analyzed by optical
emission spectographic (OES) and atomic absorption spectrophotometric (AAS) techniques."	"Calculating Ash Factor: The most satisfactory method for ashing samples to minimize loss of volatile inorganic compounds was the use of a low-temperature asher for 3 to 5 days. The low-temperature asher
operated on the principle of passing oxygen gas at 0.5- to 1-mm pressure through a radio-frequency field, splitting the oxygen into atomic oxygen. The highly active oxygen
reacted with organic material to form gaseous products below 150° C. The gases were pumped away in the vacuum system leaving only oxidized inorganic components of the samples.

 The OES technique was used to analyze the following minor and trace elements: B, Fe, Al, Mo, Cu, Co, Zn, Ti, and Ni. The method used was a modification of one reported by Taylor et al. Standards were prepared in a matrix consisting of 100mg Na2C03, 400 mg CaC03, 400 mg K2CO3, and 100 mg MgO. These were made from Johnson-Matthey spectrographic-grade reagents."	Twenty mg of the sample to be tested were mixed with 80 mg of graphite containing 50 ppm palladium. Modifications from Taylor’s method included 8 amperes of arcing time (a complete burn) and the Pd (3460.8 A) line as an internal-standard line.

The AAS technique was used to determine Ca, Mg, Na, K, and Mn. These analyses were performed when there was enough ashed material remaining after the aliquot was taken for the OES technique. Ten mg of ash were dissolved in 2 ml of HCl and diluted to 100 ml with demineralized water.	The methods used for the analysis of each element were those described in the Perkin-Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer laboratory manual. Calculations were made using the intensity-ratio method. Concn values were read from previously prepared calibration curves. All final values reported were based on the original weight of the seedlings because they were determined to be as accurate as dry weight.	The available documentation says 'The methods used for the analysis of each element were those described in the Perkin-Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer laboratory manual'. Most 1970s Perkin-Elmer AA spectrophotometers were sold as flame AAS systems (with a burner). For example, the Model 403 was commonly used in flame mode. digital.sciencehistory.org. However, the same instruments could be fitted with a Heated Graphite Atomizer (HGA) accessory, converting them to graphite-furnace AAS for trace-level work. Perkin-Elmer’s first commercial graphite furnace, the HGA-70, was introduced around 1970, and later units like the HGA-2100 extended those capabilities.
